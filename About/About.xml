  <description>I have a dream, to give my colonists a hint of desire to make them more alive, that's what this mod tries to do. 

This mod gives wishes to your colonists, these wishes appear over time or during events, they have a determining factor on your colonistss's moods. As the comfort of your colonists progresses, their wishes also become more complex. 

While you have no obligation to satisfy them, beware of their moods or beware of nightmares.
